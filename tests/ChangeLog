picotm-tests 0.1.0 (2017-04-29)
------------------

    * Added test case for STM module.

    * Restored test cases for memory allocation and file-descriptor
      I/O. The restored test cases use the new picotm interface and
      the new error-handling paradigm. Binary data files are now
      generated by the test utility while running the tests.

    * Moved tests into separate package.

    * Added build system based on GNU autotools.

    * Licensed all source code under the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.
