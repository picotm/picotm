# The dependency chain between the directories is
#
#   include -> src -> tests -> modules -> doc
#
# We first create the core headers and library from `include' and `src'.
# The `tests' directory only contains helpers for `make check'. It does not
# contain artifacts for building the regular code, but probably depends on
# the core interfaces. Modules in `modules' depend on the core library, each
# other, and their tests depend on the test infrastructure. The documentation
# in `doc' can depend on any source or header files.
