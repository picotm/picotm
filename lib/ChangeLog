picotm 0.1.0 (2017-04-29)
------------

    * Added new paradigm for error handling. The original error handling
      had to be provided by the user and was split between execution and
      commit phase of the transaction. Under the new paradigm, the error
      detection and recovery is provided by picotm. Users most only provide
      fall-back code when recovery fails.

    * Cleaned up and restructured existing source code. All code is now
      self-contained without dependencies on external compiler tools,
      besides the GNU toolchain.

    * Restored modules for memory allocation, file-descriptor I/O, VFS,
      math, and helper functions from libc.

    * Added module for Software Transactional Memory. The old STM was
      a fork of TinySTM, which also served as TM.

    * Added core transaction manager. The new TM provides an updated
      public interface and from-scratch implementation.

    * Moved tests into separate package.

    * Added build system based on GNU autotools

    * Licensed all source code under the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0
