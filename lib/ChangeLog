picotm 0.2.0 (2017-05-31)
------------

    * Improved source code documentation. The documentation is part of
      the source code and can be extracted using 'make doc'. There's a
      tutorial for each module and the overall library.

    * Improved error handling. Errors used to be signalled by returning
      an error code from the failed function. This scheme has been replaced
      in many places by an additional output parameter of type
      |struct picotm_error|. The stored value signals an error, which type
      of error, which error, and maybe an additional error message.

    * Updated module interface. The module interface has been changed to
      use |struct picotm_error| for signalling errors to picotm. Two new
      call-back functions apply() and undo() allow for performing module-
      wide apply and undo during commit or rollback of a transaction.


picotm 0.1.0 (2017-04-29)
------------

    * Added new paradigm for error handling. The original error handling
      had to be provided by the user and was split between execution and
      commit phase of the transaction. Under the new paradigm, the error
      detection and recovery is provided by picotm. Users most only provide
      fall-back code when recovery fails.

    * Cleaned up and restructured existing source code. All code is now
      self-contained without dependencies on external compiler tools,
      besides the GNU toolchain.

    * Restored modules for memory allocation, file-descriptor I/O, VFS,
      math, and helper functions from libc.

    * Added module for Software Transactional Memory. The old STM was
      a fork of TinySTM, which also served as TM.

    * Added core transaction manager. The new TM provides an updated
      public interface and from-scratch implementation.

    * Moved tests into separate package.

    * Added build system based on GNU autotools

    * Licensed all source code under the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0
