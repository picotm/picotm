  The build scripts depend on

    - GNU autotools (autoconf and automake),
    - GNU autoconf archive,
    - GNU libtool,
    - GNU make, and
    - a recent Linux (for running the build scripts).

  Source-code documentation depends on

    - doxygen, and
    - dot.

  All source code is held in a git repository, so you'll need

    - git

  for development.


Building picotm
===============

  Make sure you have all requirements installed. To prepare your build,
  invoke

    tools/bootstrap.sh

    make

  This should configure and build picotm for your system. Install with

    sudo make install

  You can find more detailed install instructions in the file INSTALL
  that comes with this package.

  If you want to generate and install source-code documentation, run
