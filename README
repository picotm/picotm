Requirements
============

  Picotm is written in C and only requires

    - a recent gcc compiler + environment, such as gcc 4.8 or later.

  The build scripts depend on

    - GNU autotools (autoconf and automake),
    - GNU autoconf archive,
    - GNU libtool,
    - GNU make, and
    - a recent Linux (for running the build scripts).

  Source-code documentation depends on

    - doxygen, and
    - dot.

  All source code is held in a git repository, so you'll need

    - git

  for development.


Building picotm
===============

  Make sure you have all requirements installed. To create a build, run

    ./configure
    make

  This should configure and build picotm for your system. Install with

    sudo make install

  You can find more detailed install instructions in the file INSTALL
  that comes with this package.

  If you want to generate and install source-code documentation, run

    make html
    sudo make install-html

  For developing picotm, you'll require a copy of picotm's Git repository.
  Run

    git clone https://github.com/picotm/picotm.git picotm
    cd picotm
    tools/bootstrap.sh

  These commands obtain a copy of the Git repository and generate the build
  system based on GNU autotools. If they succeed, you can configure, build
  and install your modified copy of picotm as described above.


Using picotm
============

  After installing, all picotm header files are in the sub-directory picotm/
  in your system's include directory. A number of program libraries should be
  in the system's library directory, each starting with the prefix picotm-.
  Which modules are available depends on your system.

  If your compiler toolchain cannot find installed header files or libraries,
  make sure that the respective install directories (e.g.,
  `/usr/local/include' and `/usr/local/lib') are listed in CPPFLAGS,
  LD_RUN_PATH, LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and similar environment variables.
