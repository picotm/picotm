/**
 * \ingroup group_lib
 * \brief A reader-writer lock.
 *
 * The `struct picotm_rwlock` data structure implements a reader-writer
 * lock. Each instance can only be acquired at most once by each transaction.
 * The implementation does not track which transactions acquired the lock, so
 * transactions have to ensure that they acquire each lock at most once.
 *
 * Before using an instance of `struct picotm_rwlock`, initialize as show
 * below.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      struct picotm_rwlock rwlock;
 *
 *      picotm_rwlock_init(&rwlock);
 * ~~~
 *
 * The function `picotm_rwlock_init()` cannot fail. All fields of the
 * structure are private.
 *
 * Alternatively, the macro `PICOTM_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER` initializes a
 * static or stack-allocated R/W-lock variable. If both, function and
 * macro initialization, is possible, the macro form is prefered.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      struct picotm_rwlock rwlock = PICOTM_RWLOCK_INITIALIZER;
 * ~~~
 *
 * Likewise, uninitialize with `picotm_rwlock_uninit()` as shown below.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      picotm_rwlock_uninit(&rwlock);
 * ~~~
 *
 * The function `picotm_rwlock_try_rdlock()` acquires a reader lock. With
 * too many readers, the function fails with a conflict. You should always
 * check the error parameter and perform recovery if necessary.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      struct picotm_error error;
 *
 *      picotm_rwlock_try_rdlock(&rwlock, &error);
 *      if (picotm_error_is_set(&error)) {
 *          // probably busy; start recovery
 *      }
 * ~~~
 *
 * The function `picotm_rwlock_try_wrlock()` acquires a writer lock, or
 * upgrades a transaction's reader lock to a writer lock. With concurrent
 * users, the function fails with a conflict. A reader lock can be updated
 * to a writer lock at most once.
 *
 * As with `picotm_rwlock_try_rdlock()`, you should always check the error
 * parameter and perform recovery if necessary.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      // Upgrade to writer lock
 *      picotm_rwlock_try_wrlock(&rwlock, true, &error);
 *      if (picotm_error_is_set(&error)) {
 *          // concurrent users; start recovery
 *      }
 * ~~~
