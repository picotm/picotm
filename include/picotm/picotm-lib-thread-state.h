/**
 * \ingroup group_lib
 * \file
 * \brief Contains thread-state helper macros.
 *
 * On top of the set of state helper macros, picotm provides thread-state
 * helper macros. These macros provide a single per-thread instance of a
 * state variable.
 *
 * Thread-local state requires the definition of a regular state variable.
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 *  struct state {
 *      int data1;
 *      int data2;
 *  };
 *
 *  void
 *  init_state_fields(struct state* state, struct picotm_error* error)
 *  {
 *      state->data1 = 0;
 *      state->data2 = 0;
 *  }
 *
 *  void
 *  uninit_state_fields(struct state* state)
 *  {
 *      // nothing to do
 *  }
 *
 *  PICOTM_STATE(state, struct state);
 *  PICOTM_STATE_STATIC_IMPL(state, struct state,
 *                           init_state_fields,
 *                           uninit_state_fields)
 * ~~~
 *
 * `PICOTM_THREAD_STATE_STATIC_IMPL()` defines the thread-local state for the
 * state variable.
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 *  PICOTM_THREAD_STATE_STATIC_IMPL(state)
 * ~~~
 *
 * The macros `PICOTM_THREAD_STATE_ACQUIRE()` and
 * `PICOTM_THREAD_STATE_RELEASE()` acquire and release the state variable
 * in the same way as their state counterparts. The difference is that
 * there's only one instance of the state variable for each thread.
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 *  struct picotm_error error = PICOTM_ERROR_INITIALIZER;
 *
 *  struct state* state = PICOTM_THREAD_STATE_ACQUIRE(state, true, &error);
 *  if (picotm_error_is_set(&error)) {
 *      // perform error handling
 *  }
 *
 *  // ...
 *
 *  // do something with 'state'
 *
 *  // ...
 *
 *  // In thread-local cleanup code
 *  PICOTM_THREAD_STATE_RELEASE(state, state_var);
 * ~~~
