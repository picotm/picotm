/**
 * \ingroup group_lib
 * \file
 *
 * \brief Contains `struct picotm_rwstate` and helpers.
 *
 * The data structure `struct picotm_rwstate` represents a transaction's
 * status wrt. shared state.
 *
 * For example, shared state might be an integer with an associated
 * reader/writer lock.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      int i;
 *      struct picotm_rwlock i_lock;
 *
 *      i = 0;
 *      picotm_rwlock_init(&i_lock);
 * ~~~
 *
 * Each transaction accessing the integer `i` contains a reader/writer
 * state value of type `struct picotm_rwstate`. The transaction has to
 * initialize the state value with a call to `picotm_rwstate_init()`.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      struct picotm_rwstate i_state;
 *
 *      picotm_rwstate_init(&i_state);
 * ~~~
 *
 * Alternatively, the macro `PICOTM_RWSTATE_INITIALIZER` initializes a
 * static or stack-allocated R/W-state variable. If both, function and
 * macro initialization, is possible, the macro form is prefered.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      struct picotm_rwstate i_state = PICOTM_RWSTATE_INITIALIZER;
 * ~~~
 *
 * To safely read the value of resource `i`, a transaction has to acquire
 * the reader lock `i_lock`.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      struct picotm_error error = PICOTM_ERROR_INITIALIZER;
 *
 *      picotm_rwstate_try_rdlock(&i_state, &i_lock, &error);
 *      if (picotm_error_is_set(&error)) {
 *          // perform recovery
 *      }
 *
 *      // read i
 * ~~~
 *
 * A call to `picotm_rwstate_try_rdlock()` acquires a reader lock and sets
 * the transaction's reader/writer state accordingly. If the reader lock
 * could not be acquired, an error is returned. In this case, the transaction
 * should initiate a recovery.
 *
 * To safely write, a transaction has to acquire the writer lock `i_lock`.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      picotm_rwstate_try_wrlock(&i_state, &i_lock, &error);
 *      if (picotm_error_is_set(&error)) {
 *          // perform recovery
 *      }
 *
 *      // write i
 * ~~~
 *
 * Depending on the transaction's current reader/writer state, the function
 * `picotm_rwstate_try_wrlock()` automatically updates a reader lock to a
 * writer lock.
 *
 * Reader/writer locks can only be acquired once by each transaction, and
 * possibly upgraded once by each transaction. The reader/writer state
 * variable keeps track of the transaction's lock state, so locks can be
 * acquired and upgraded multiple times.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      picotm_rwstate_try_wrlock(&i_state, &i_lock, &error);
 *      if (picotm_error_is_set(&error)) {
 *          // perform recovery
 *      }
 *      picotm_rwstate_try_rdlock(&i_state, &i_lock, &error);
 *      if (picotm_error_is_set(&error)) {
 *          // perform recovery
 *      }
 *      picotm_rwstate_try_wrlock(&i_state, &i_lock, &error);
 *      if (picotm_error_is_set(&error)) {
 *          // perform recovery
 *      }
 * ~~~
 *
 * In any case, a reader-writer lock can only be unlocked *once,* using
 * `picotm_rwstate_unlock()`.
 * ~~~ c
 *      picotm_rwstate_unlock(&i_state, &i_lock);
 * ~~~
 *
 * The current reader/writer state can be queried using
 * `picotm_rwstate_get_status()`, which returns one of
 * `enum picotm_rwstate_status`. Using `picotm_rwstate_set_status()`, the
 * status can also be set explicitly. This might be useful when adopting
 * pre-acquired reader/writer locks, but it's generally preferable to use
 * reader/writer state interfaces for locking and unlocking.
 *
 * Finally, to uninitialize a reader/writer state the transaction has to
 * call `picotm_rwstate_uninit()`.
 *
 * ~~~ c
 *      picotm_rwstate_uninit(&i_state);
 * ~~~
