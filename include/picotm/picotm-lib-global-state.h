/**
 * \ingroup group_lib
 * \file
 * \brief Contains global-state helper macros.
 *
 * Picotm provides helper macros for maintaining shared state. Oftentimes
 * a single shared state is used throughout a module. For this case, picotm
 * provides additional helper macros that maintain such global state. The
 * example below declares shared state of type `struct shared`.
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 *  struct shared {
 *      int data1;
 *      int data2;
 *  };
 *
 *  void
 *  init_shared_fields(struct shared* shared, struct picotm_error* error)
 *  {
 *      shared->data1 = 0;
 *      shared->data2 = 0;
 *  }
 *
 *  void
 *  uninit_shared_fields(struct shared* shared)
 *  {
 *      // nothing to do
 *  }
 *
 *  PICOTM_SHARED_STATE(shared, struct shared);
 *  PICOTM_SHARED_STATE_STATIC_IMPL(shared,
 *                                  init_shared_fields,
 *                                  uninit_shared_fields)
 * ~~~
 *
 * A single global state variable for an existing shared state is declared
 * with `PICOTM_GLOBAL_STATE_STATIC_IMPL()`. This macro receives the name
 * of the shared state and expands to an implementation.
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 *  PICOTM_GLOBAL_STATE_STATIC_IMPL(shared)
 * ~~~
 *
 * Users acquire a reference to the global state with
 * `PICOTM_GLOBAL_STATE_REF()` and release a previously acquired reference
 * with a call to `PICOTM_GLOBAL_STATE_UNREF()`.
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 *  struct picotm_error error = PICOTM_ERROR_INITIALIZER;
 *
 *  struct shared* state = PICOTM_GLOBAL_STATE_REF(shared, &error);
 *  if (picotm_error_is_set(&error)) {
 *      // perform error handling
 *  }
 *
 *  // ...
 *
 *  // do something with 'state'
 *
 *  // ...
 *
 *  // In thread-local cleanup code
 *  PICOTM_GLOBAL_STATE_UNREF(shared);
 * ~~~
 *
 * Global state is implemented on top of shared state, so the same rules
 * for thread-safety apply. All references and releases are serialized with
 * each other and the initializer and clean-up functions. Concurrent access
 * to shared data files requires additional concurrency control.
