/**
 * Marks a non-transactional variable in a function.
 *
 * When restarting a transaction, picotm uses non-local goto, based on
 * the `sigjmp()` and `longjmp()` functions provided by the C Standard
 * Library. These functions save and restore the thread's instruction
 * and stack pointer, but don't save any variables. This can result in
 * program errors if a variable is held in a register that changes its
 * value between invocations of `sigjmp()` and `longjmp()`. The call
 * to `longjmp()` will not restore the variable's original value.
 *
 * To avoid this problem, mark local, non-transactional variables with
 * ::picotm_safe as shown below.
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 *  picotm_safe int var = 0;
 *
 *  picotm_begin
 *
 *      [...]
 *
 *  picotm_commit
 *
 *  picotm_end
 * ~~~
 *
 * Even with ::picotm_safe, you still have to privatize the variable when
 * using it within the transaction.
 *
 * With gcc, the command-line option '-Wclobbered' enables a warning about
 * this problem.

/**
 * \defgroup group_lib The picotm Programming Interface
 *
 * \brief This section provides information for users of picotm. It explains
 *        the concept of transactions and how to run a transaction with
 *        picotm.
 *
 * # Properties of a Transaction {#lib_properties_of_a_transaction}
 *
 * The transaction concept is a powerful metaphor for implementing concurrent
 * and fault-tolerant software. A transaction system provides two services
 * to it's users. These are
 *
 *  -   concurrency control (i.e., thread-safe access to shared resources), and
 *  -   error handling.
 *
 * # Writing Transactions       {#lib_writing_transactions}
 *
 * Each transactions contains at least the statements
 *
 *  1.  ::picotm_begin,
 *  2.  ::picotm_commit, and
 *  3.  ::picotm_end
 *
 * in this exact order. In the source code, this looks like this
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 * void
 * func()
 * {
 *      // non-transactional code
 *
 *      int x = 0;
 *
 *      picotm_begin
 *          // transactional code
 *      picotm_commit
 *      picotm_end
 *
 *      // more non-transactional code
 * }
 *
 * ~~~
 *
 * Transactional operations are invoked between ::picotm_begin and
 * ::picotm_commit. This is called the transaction's *execution phase.*
 * Operations listed in the execution phase are subject to speculative
 * execution. This means that an operation might be executed, but it's
 * effects are not be permanent until the transaction commits.
 *
 * The transaction performs a commit when the user invokes ::picotm_commit.
 * This is called the *commit phase.* It is completely implemented by
 * picotm. No intervention by the user is required.
 *
 * Upon entering the commit phase, picotm validates the consistency of
 * all resources that the transaction uses. If validation succeeds, the
 * transaction's effects are applied to become permanent. The program then
 * continuous with the next operation after ::picotm_end.
 * If validation fails, the transaction's effects are reverted and the
 * transaction restarts from ::picotm_begin. The roll-back is transparent
 * to the program.
 *
 * If an operation fails, picotm provides error handling for it's operations.
 * Error handling consists of
 *
 *  -   error detection, and
 *  -   error recovery.
 *
 * Error detection is completely implemented by picotm an it's module. When
 * picotm invokes an operation it tests for reported errors. No intervention
 * by the user is required.
 *
 * Error recovery is partially provided by picotm. For picotm, it is possible
 * to recover from some errors. For example, if a write operation to a file
 * temporarily fails, picotm can retry.
 *
 * Some errors require special program logic to recover. For example, if the
 * program runs out of memory, it might free up memory by invoking a garbage
 * collector. This cannot generally be implemented by picotm, as it depends
 * on program-specific constraints. This is called the *recovery phase.*
 *
 * Error-recovery code is located between ::picotm_commit and ::picotm_end.
 * If picotm detects an error that is cannot recover from, it rolls back the
 * transaction's effects and jumps to the first instruction *after*
 * ::picotm_commit. The program now has the chance of performing error
 * recovery and, if successful, restart the transaction by calling
 * picotm_restart().

/**
 * \mainpage The picotm System-Level Transaction Manager
 *
 * Picotm is a system-level transaction manager. It provides transactional
 * semantics for low-level and operating-system functionality. Itâ€™s flexible
 * and extensible to cover exactly your requirements. **Error handling** and
 * **thread isolation** are provided by picotm, all you have to implement is
 * the application logic.
 *
 * Picotm is implemented in plain C and is well-suited for implementing
 * applications and firmware that is secure, reliable and thread-safe; yet
 * easy to develop. This makes picotm well-suited for **multi-threaded**
 * and **fault-tolerant** software.
 *
 * Picotm is Open Source under the terms of the [MIT License][license:mit];
 * viable for use in free and proprietary software.
