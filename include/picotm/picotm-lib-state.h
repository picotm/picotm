/**
 * \ingroup group_lib
 * \file
 * \brief Contains state helper macros.
 *
 * Picotm provides helpers for managing state. State can be acquired and
 * released as needed. When acquiring state, an initializer function sets
 * up the state fields; when releasing the state, a clean-up function
 * release the state fields. The example below declares state of type
 * `struct state`
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 *  struct state {
 *      int data1;
 *      int data2;
 *  };
 *
 *  void
 *  init_state_fields(struct state* state, struct picotm_error* error)
 *  {
 *      state->data1 = 0;
 *      state->data2 = 0;
 *  }
 *
 *  void
 *  uninit_state_fields(struct state* state)
 *  {
 *      // nothing to do
 *  }
 *
 *  PICOTM_STATE(state, struct state);
 *  PICOTM_STATE_STATIC_IMPL(state, struct state,
 *                           init_state_fields,
 *                           uninit_state_fields)
 * ~~~
 *
 * The macro `PICOTM_STATE()` defines state. Callers pass the state's
 * name and data structure. The macro `PICOTM_STATE_STATIC_IMPL()` defines
 * the corresponding implementation with the initializer and clean-up
 * functions supplied as arguments.
 *
 * At this point, `PICOTM_STATE_TYPE()` declares a variable of the state's
 * type. State variables must be initialized with `PICOTM_STATE_INITIALIZER`.
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 *  PICOTM_STATE_TYPE(state) state_var = PICOTM_STATE_INITIALIZER;
 * ~~~
 *
 * The macro `PICOTM_STATE_ACQUIRE()` returns the state of a state variable.
 * On it's first invocation, it runs the provided initializer function. Later
 * invocations return the already initialized state; until the state is
 * released with `PICOTM_STATE_RELEASE()`. This macro runs the provided
 * clean-up function and releases the state.
 *
 * ~~~{.c}
 *  struct picotm_error error = PICOTM_ERROR_INITIALIZER;
 *
 *  struct state* state = PICOTM_STATE_ACQUIRE(state, state_var, true, &error);
 *  if (picotm_error_is_set(&error)) {
 *      // perform error handling
 *  }
 *
 *  // ...
 *
 *  // do something with 'state'
 *
 *  // ...
 *
 *  // In thread-local cleanup code
 *  PICOTM_STATE_RELEASE(state, state_var);
 * ~~~
 *
 * State handling is not thread safe. For a thread-safe implemenation,
 * `PICOTM_SHARED_STATE()` and its helpers are available.
