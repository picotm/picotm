/**
 * \defgroup group_txlib The Transactional Data-Structures Module
 *
 * \brief The txlib module provides data structures that are safe to
 *        use from within transactions and cooperate with the transaction
 *        manager. Currently supported are lists, queues, multisets and
 *        stacks.
 *
 * Txlib, the transactional data-structures module, provides data structures
 * that are safe and efficient to use from within transactions. Each data
 * strcuture's implementation cooperates with the transaction manager to
 * provide concurrency control and error recovery.
 *
 * As a quick example, the following code removes an entry from a source
 * list and appends it to a destination list. The change becomes globally
 * visible during the transaction's successful commit. Concurrent,
 * conflicting access to the list data strcutures is detected and resolved
 * automatically. If the transaction has to roll back at any point, the
 * invoked operation are reverted and the lists return to their previous
 * state.
 *

 *      struct txlist_state src_list_state = TXLIST_STATE_INITIALIZER(src_list_state);
 *      struct txlist_state dst_list_state = TXLIST_STATE_INITIALIZER(dst_list_state);
 *
 *      struct txlist_entry list_entry = TXLIST_ENTRY_INITIALIZER;

 *          struct txlist* dst_list = txlist_of_state_tx(&dst_list_state);
 *
 *          // The list state for 'src_list' already contains the entry.
 *          txlist_erase_tx(src_list, &list_entry);
