How to make a new release?
==========================

Here's a list of steps to follow when releasing a new version of release
of picotm. If any of these steps fails, stop the release process.

  1a) If you are making a major or minor release:

        From the git master branch, create a new branch 'vx.y', where 'x'
        and 'y' are the major and minor version numbers of your release.
        The micro version 'z' should be 0. This branch can later be used
        for bug-fix releases with increasing micro versions.

  1b) If you are making a bug-fix release:

        Make sure the git branch 'vx.y' is based on the git tag 'vx.y.0'
        in the git master branch.

  2) Update

        * the Changelog files in lib/, and

        * the package version in configure.ac in lib/.

  3) Commit your changes to the branch 'vx.y'.

  4) Generate packages by running 'make dist' for lib/. This
     should produce the package files picotm-x.y.z.tar.gz.

  5) Test generated packages by unpacking and building the content
     of the package file. You can merge steps 4) and 5) by running
     'make distcheck', instead of 'make dist'.

  6a) If you are making a major or minor release:

        Generate documentation by running 'make html' for lib/. Create
        a new documentation package by packing the resulting directory
        doc/html in the package 'picotm-doc-x.y.tar.gz'.

  6b) If you are making a bug-fix release:

        You should not have to recreate the documentation package. If
        any public interface changed, it's not a bug-fix release.

  7a) If you are making a major or minor release:

        Rebase-merge your changes into the master branch of the git repository
        and upload the changes to GitHub. You can do this by opening a pull
        request.

  7b) If you are making a bug-fix release:

        You should not have to merge your changes into master, as they are
        already present there. Bugs are first fixed on the master branch and
        then ported to bug-fix releases.

  8) Tag the new release in git as 'vx.y.z' by tagging the revision in the
     master branch. Sign the tag. Push the new tag to GitHub.

  9) Upload the package files and ChangeLog to GitHub.
